About Me

I was born and raised in Paphos, a small town in Cyprus, an island that is the 'center' of the world.   
  
I have studied Photography at Middlesex University where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Photography in 2009\. Since 2009, I attended seminars and I participated in multiple advanced photography workshops (advance lighting, advance posing, photo journalism etc.). Also, I participated in Group Exhibitions, both in Greece and Cyprus.   
  
During my professional career throughout these years, I cooperated with big studios in London, Athens and Cyprus. Furthermore, I worked as a senior photographer at the National Theater of Greece.   
  
I would like to comment that I have great experience with weddings, civil weddings, christenings, events carried from beginning to the end with professionalism and consistency.   
  
As a professional i try to stay away from the typical and am always on the hunt for new ideas, techniques and interesting people!   
  
I like to treat each and every client like they are my friend and by doing so creating, not only capturing, more natural interactions on "film" but also producing better images.   
  
I find that photography is not just about having a natural eye behind the camera; picking out the right angle; or just magically getting exposures correct. Photography is about knowing the location, the light, the subject and enhancing all of them in the process.   
  
Don't hesitate to contact me, I would love to have a chat with you, and answer any questions you may you have about your Wedding photography.
